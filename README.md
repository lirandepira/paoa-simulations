**Introducing PAOA: Sub-universal Variational Circuits for Combinatorial Optimization Problems**

*Gal Weitz, LirandÃ« Pira, Chris Ferrie, Joshua Combes*

This code designs and implements the probabilistic approximate optimization algorithm (PAOA). PAOA can be seen as the classical analogue of the well-known quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).

In this simulation, we benchmark PAOA and its reduced versions, in comparison with the QAOA in three different layer configurations (1, 3, 6). We also provide comparisons with brute force and random guessing.
